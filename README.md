Full Stack Capstone project - Uses NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, React and Redux.

## Introduction
Social Gamers is a social network built for gamers. 

## Use Case
Why is the app useful? As a gamer I have made many friends in-game but I rarely get to know the people outside of the game. With this app, gamers can explore a community of people who enjoy doing what they do. The network is not made for just posting about games, but posting life status updates as well. A great way to help gamers broaden their connections.

The app is responsive and will scale with different size devices.
